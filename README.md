# FRC-8129
I don't wanna complain about it, but their arrogant provoke my dissatisfied...
8129 is the team that can't do everything well.
U know why they always lose the game?
'cause they doesn't work, like their robot, and they think playing equals to working.
When I was codeing in few months ago, they did not want to help and they forlicked aside, it's really disturb my feelings.
Also, the leader was playing with them, and said why did I still codeing, I was so dissatisfied....
There's a saying:" A man cannot live without heart".
What a shame on themselves...
